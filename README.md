# DEFCON25_Attack_Defend_ActiveDirectory_Workshop
This hands on workshop teaches you how to both attack and defend Active Directory. We will start by deploying an Active Directory environment using the typical security settings found in most medium to large organizations. Participants will then learn current common methods and tools used to exploit Active Directory against their test environments. Participants will create a hardened Active Directory environment using advanced methods to secure domain controllers from attack and then try to compromise their hardened environments.
